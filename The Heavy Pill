Q. You have 20 bottles of pills. 
19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. 
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?
You can only use the scale once.

Solution
1. Take number of pills from each bottle according to the position number of the bottle

2. multiply each bottle weigh with it's position number starting from 1 to 20
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,..

3. if all bottles were of weigh 1, sum of idealWeigh with position number at last index
idealWeigh = n*(n+1)/2 = 20*19/2 = 210

4. Actual wt would have .1 gram extra at one of the positions

5. position number of heavier pills bottle = (actualWeigh - idealWeigh when all are 1gm)(ActualWTcalculated - idealWeigh)/0.1
